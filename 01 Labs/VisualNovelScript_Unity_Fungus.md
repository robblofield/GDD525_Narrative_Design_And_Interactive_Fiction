**ILLYANA:**
“Don’t worry. That title sounds dramatic, but most of us are pretty normal. Mostly. Some days. Anyway… hi.”

“We’re your greeting committee today. If you want to look around, ask questions, or head to another room, just say the word!”

# **BLOCK 2 — WHAT’S IN THIS ROOM?**

**KITTY:**
“This is the main common room. Students hang out here between training sessions, classes, and… well… occasional world-ending emergencies.”

**ILLYANA:**
“There’s a teleport circle tucked behind that bookshelf. Don’t step on it unless you want to visit my home dimension. Trust me, you don’t.”

**KITTY** *(cuts in quickly)*:
“Anyway! Mostly safe, mostly normal. There’s a bulletin board over there with notices, missions, and club sign-ups.”

## **BLOCK 2A — TRAINING SESSIONS**

**KITTY:**
“Not *for fun*! For tactical education. And okay sometimes it’s a little fun.”

**PLAYER CHOICE:**

* **“Got it. Back to my questions.”** → Return to BLOCK 0

## **BLOCK 2B — BULLETIN BOARD**

**KITTY:**
“You’ll see announcements from staff, class schedules, reminders, and a surprising number of missing snack notices.”

“Someone keeps stealing my energy bars. If you hear anything, let me know.”

**PLAYER CHOICE:**

* **“Okay. Back to the main questions.”** → Return to BLOCK 0

# **BLOCK 3 — WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT?**

**KITTY:**
“If you’re new, I'd recommend exploring a bit. Get a feel for the place.”

**ILLYANA:**
“Some of the other students are around today. Each room has someone you can talk to. They’re… all characters.”

**KITTY:**
“You can head to the **Training Wing**, the **Library**, or the **Courtyard**. Each place has someone who can show you the ropes.”

“Or cause trouble. But in a friendly way.”

“If you hear explosions, that’s normal.”

**PLAYER CHOICE:**

* **“Thanks. Back to questions.”** → Return to BLOCK 0

## **BLOCK 3B — LIBRARY INFO**

**ILLYANA:**

**PLAYER CHOICE:**

* **“Good to know. Back to questions.”** → Return to BLOCK 0

## **BLOCK 3C — COURTYARD INFO**

**KITTY:**
“The Courtyard’s a relaxing spot. Great for a break from training.”

“And sometimes home to wildlife that wandered in from alternate dimensions. Just step carefully.”

**KITTY:**
“She’s joking. …Mostly.”

**PLAYER CHOICE:**

* **“Alright. Back to questions.”** → Return to BLOCK 0

# **BLOCK 4 — EXIT THE ROOM**
